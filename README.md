# Meta

This is where Sequent puts:
- reusable cross-project code
- templates, code, and documentation required for getting a repository working
- Plan and schedule open source activities, like out Public Product Roadmap

## Reusable Github Workflows

In [`.github/workflows`] you can find a list of [reusable Github Workflows], to
be easily reused in other Sequent repositories (or by anyone else really).
