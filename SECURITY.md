Thanks for helping make Sequent safe for everyone.

## Security

Sequent takes the security of our software products and services seriously, including all of the open source code repositories managed through our Sequent organizations, such as [Sequentech github organization](https://github.com/sequentech).

Even though we do not currently have a bug bounty program and we do not currently provide bug bounty rewards, we will ensure that your finding gets passed along to the appropriate maintainers for remediation. 

## Reporting Security Issues

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in any Sequent-owned repository, please report it to us through coordinated disclosure.

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public Sequent issues, discussions, or pull requests.**

Instead, please report vulnerabilities following [Github instructions to privately report security vulnerabilities](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability#privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability) in the [sequentech/meta repository -> Security tab](https://github.com/sequentech/meta/security). Use that to report a security vulnerability for **any** Sequent software products and services.

Please include as much of the information listed below as you can to help us better understand and resolve the issue:

  * The type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, or cross-site scripting)
  * Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
  * The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
  * Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
  * Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
  * Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
  * Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

This information will help us triage your report more quickly. We recommend you
to follow [Github Security Lab report template](https://github.com/github/securitylab/blob/main/docs/report-template.md).
