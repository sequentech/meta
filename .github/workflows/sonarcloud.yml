# This workflow uses actions that are not certified by GitHub and is based on
# They are provided by a third-party and are governed by
# separate terms of service, privacy policy, and support
# documentation.

# This workflow helps you trigger a SonarCloud analysis of your code and populates
# GitHub Code Scanning alerts with the vulnerabilities found.
# Free for open source project.

# 1. Login to SonarCloud.io using your GitHub account

# 2. Import your project on SonarCloud
#     * Add your GitHub organization first, then add your repository as a new
#       project.
#     * Please note that many languages are eligible for automatic analysis,
#       which means that the analysis will start automatically without the need
#       to set up GitHub Actions.
#     * This behavior can be changed in Administration > Analysis Method.
#
# 3. Follow the SonarCloud in-product tutorial
#     * a. Copy/paste the Project Key and the Organization Key into the args
#          parameter below (You'll find this information in SonarCloud. Click on
#          "Information" at the bottom left)
#
#     * b. Generate a new token and add it to your Github repository's secrets
#          using the name SONAR_TOKEN (On SonarCloud, click on your avatar on
#          top-right > My account > Security or go directly to
#          https://sonarcloud.io/account/security/)
